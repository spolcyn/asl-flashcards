# ASL Flashcards User Guide


## Purpose

The ASL flashcards app makes it easy to split a class vocabulary video into
individual videos that correspond to the vocabularly list it was created for.

It is meant to help create flashcards for the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
flashcard software. Support for learning about how to use Anki is not (and will
not be) offered in these docs. Those interested are encouraged to look at the
many resources elsewhere on the Internet.


## Tutorial

### Required Materials

1. Video file with instructor signing each vocabulary word
2. CSV vocabularly list file containing the start time of each word and the English translation
   of what is being signed. See [Format Specification](#format-spec) for more
   details.

### Step 1: Creating the CSV Vocabulary List File

The recommended way to do this is using VLC. Before proceeding, follow the
instructions in the [appendix](#appendix-a) to set up VLC for this step, if you
haven't already.

1. Create the vocabulary list in a spreadsheet

    1. Using a program like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, etc., make
       a spreadsheet with columns according to the [Format
       Specification](#format-spec).
    2. In the `word` column, enter each of your vocabulary words (one per row)
       in the order they appear in the vocabulary video.
    3. At the end, your spreadsheet should look like [the
       example](#rendered-vocabulary-csv), but with all columns other than
       `word` empty.

2. Open your video in VLC.

    1. Play the video until the first word starts. As soon as the motion begins,
       pause the video, and in the row in your spreadsheet corresponding to the
       word that is about to be signed, write down the timestamp (in seconds)
       shown by the VLC plugin on the video. For example, you might write down
       `1.902` in your spreadsheet next to the first word.
    2. Continue playing/pausing the video until you have a starting timestamp
       for all signs in the video. Be careful not to put the starting timestamp
       too late, or your flashcard's sign video will be cut off!
    3. When complete, export your spreadsheet as a CSV file. Google `export as
       CSV <your spreadsheet program>` to find resources on how to do so if you
       don't know how, e.g., `export as CSV excel`.

### Step 2: Using the ASL Flashcards App

Once you've finished your CSV vocabulary list file, you're ready to use the app.
This should be the easiest part!

1. Under `Vocab and Timing List Upload`, upload your CSV vocabulary list file.
   Your file will be validated, and a preview of your file will appear.
2. Under `Video Upload`, upload the vocabulary video corresponding to your
   vocabulary list.

The video will then be split into one video for each word. This could take some
time, especially if your video is long. After the split is complete, you can
download all your word videos at once.

You can also download a CSV file that has all the necessary data in the proper
format to import cards in bulk to Anki. See [Importing Flashcards to
Anki](#anki-import) for more details.

### Step 3: Importing Flashcards to Anki

#### Step 3.1: Importing Media

After unzipping your video file, you should have a folder with a each of your
word videos in it. We'll copy all of those videos to the Anki media folder,
which is named `collections.media` where it stores things like videos, images,
and sounds that you can use in your flashcards.

1. Go to <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations">https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations</a> and find the folder that corresponds to your OS.
2. Navigate to that folder.
3. In that folder, open the `collections.media` folder.
4. Copy all the word video files you downloaded into this folder. IMPORTANT: Do
   not rename these videos, or the Anki importable CSV created by the app will
   not work!

Your media is now accessible by Anki.

#### Step 3.2: Importing Cards

1. Open Anki.
2. Open the deck you want to import the cards to.
3. Use the Anki menus to select "Import" (on a Mac, as of this writing, that's
   `File -> Import`.
4. Select the CSV you downloaded from the app after splitting your videos.
    1. Note that the first column of the CSV is the word, and the second column
       is the path to the video file for that word.
5. Select the card type to import to (`Basic (and reversed card)` is
   recommended).
6. Click `Import`.
7. You're done. Go study!

## Format Specifications

### CSV Vocabulary List File Specification
CSV is an output format of many spreadsheet programs that's useful for storing
data that is naturally arranged in columns.

1. The [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file MUST
   be as follows:
    1. The first column MUST be titled `word`
        1. The values in the `word` column can be anything and SHOULD correspond
           to the English translation of the sign
    2. The second column MUST be titled `start_time`
        1. The values in the `start_time` column must be float (decimal) numbers
           of the form `A.XYZ`. For example, `1.234`


#### Example of a Valid CSV Vocabulary List:
```
word,start_time
HELLO, 0.001
*wave*: hello or good bye, 2.604
GOOD+MORNING, 4.655
GOOD+AFTERNOON (formal), 7.152
GOOD+EVENING (formal), 9.500
GOOD+NIGHT, 12.655
```

Which, as a table, looks like:
<a name="rendered-vocabulary-csv"></a>

|word                     |start_time|
|-------------------------|----------|
|HELLO                    | 0.001    |
|*wave*: hello or good bye| 2.604    |
|GOOD+MORNING             | 4.655    |
|GOOD+AFTERNOON (formal)  | 7.152    |
|GOOD+EVENING (formal)    | 9.500    |
|GOOD+NIGHT               | 12.655   |
